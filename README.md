Advent of Code Solutions using Kotlin

### About

Advent of Code is a great opportunity to learn a new language. I'm attempting it for my first time using Kotlin. So far, Kotlin has been a pretty cool language to work with. It's like Python & Java had a baby and raised it with an irrational fear of mutability. So basically perfect.

There's a lot of cool & exciting things in Kotlin that I haven't experienced before:
- Infix functions, which make code more readable
- Extension functions, to add new methods to stdlib classes
- Type inference, to make code less verbose, but still safe
- Data classes, for when data/methods arne't *not quite* ready to be a fully fledged class

    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
